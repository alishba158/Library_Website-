# 📚 Readify – Library Management Website

**Readify** is a responsive **Library Management Website** built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.
It allows users to manage a digital library where they can **add, search, borrow, return, and track books**.
The project is fully frontend-based and uses **LocalStorage** for data persistence.
